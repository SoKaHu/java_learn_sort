# java_learn_sort
Learning Java part 7 - sorting


This was coded as part of a TUM introduction in programming course.
The program is a UTF8-coded java file. The MiniJava file was provided by the chair of Algorithms and Complexity of TU Munich.

Instructions:
Implement a Multiply and Surrender Algorithm, the SlowSort Algorithm. 
Slowsort is a recursive algorithm which divides an array in two parts and compares the highest elements of these two parts. 
Sort the first and second part of the array recursively with SlowSort. Find the maximum and place it at the end of the array. Then sort the rest of the array.

Also implement EvenSlowerSort which divides the array in 3 parts. It works the same as SlowSort.
